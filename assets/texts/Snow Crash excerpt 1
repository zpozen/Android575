The billboard is a classic, a chestnut, 
not a figment of some fleeting Mafia 
promotional campaign. It is a statement, 
a monument built to endure. Simple and dignified. 
It shows Uncle Enzo in one of his spiffy Italian suits. 
The pinstripes glint and flex like sinews. 
The pocket square is luminous. His hair is perfect, 
slicked back with something that never comes off, 
each strand cut off straight and square at the end 
by Uncle Enzo's cousin, Art the Barber, who runs 
the second-largest chain of low-end haircutting 
establishments in the world. Uncle Enzo is standing 
there, not exactly smiling, an avuncular glint 
in his eye for sure, not posing like a model 
but standing there like your uncle would, and it says

The Mafia
you've got a friend in The Family!
paid for by the Our Thing Foundation

The billboard serves as the Deliverator's polestar. 
He knows that when he gets to the place on CSV-5 
where the bottom corner of the billboard is obscured 
by the pseudo-Gothic stained-glass arches of the 
local Reverend Wayne's Pearly Gates franchise, 
it's time for him to get over into the right lanes 
where the retards and the bimbo boxes poke along, 
random, indecisive, looking at each passing 
franchise's driveway like they don't know if 
it's a promise or a threat.
